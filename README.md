## Security

### Best Practices

- Run OpenClaw in a sandboxed environment
- Limit file system access to necessary directories
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Regularly update to the latest version
- Review skills before installing
- Don't expose instances to the public internet

### Security Tools

| Project | Stars | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| [aquaman](https://github.com/tech4242/aquaman) | - | Credential isolation proxy — API keys never enter the agent process, injected via UDS from Keychain/1Password/Vault/keepassxc |

### Security Resources

- [CrowdStrike Analysis](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/what-security-teams-need-to-know-about-openclaw-ai-super-agent/) - Security team guide

- Malicious instructions can be embedded in ingested data
- Misconfigured setups may leak sensitive data
